# Flask Blog Post Application using SQLAlchemy and Jinja

## Motivation

This project was inspired by the tutorials from DigitalOcean covering the Flask framework. I am looking to implement the features
that were suggested at the end of the tutorials.

## In progress

- user profile model
- authentication

## Project Requirements

- user should be logged in before adding any blog posts
- user should be able to view blog posts in the main page regardless of whether logged in or not

## Additional Features

- comments to a blog post (user must be logged in before commenting)
- upload images to a blog post
- when the user views his/her own profile, display all the blog posts and comments that he/she has created
- user avatar?
